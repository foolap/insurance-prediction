# insurance-prediction
This is my sample project on training multiple regression models on kaggle dataset.
Models are trained and compared. Project contains Flask aplication with users interface, which allows user to predict his insurance cost according to training data and the best fitting model.
I did not write any of js and css code used for Flask app.
